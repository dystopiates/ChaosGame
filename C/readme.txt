NOTE: This only builds with the clang compiler.

Just `cd` to ChaosGame/C and:

clang *.c *.h -lm

Then, run ./a.out


This C version was me rewriting some of my Python project into C so I could explore
fractals more deeply. The end result was roughly a 100x speedup. See main.c for
some helpful comments.

All the comments I leave
/*
 * Like this
 */
Are comments I added just for this upload.
Any comments
// like this
are commented out code.
