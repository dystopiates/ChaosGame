Open a terminal, cd to ChaosGame/Python

run `python3 -m venv venv` (create a virtual env, named venv)
run `source venv/bin/activate` (This activates the virtual env)
run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (This installs Pillow, the main image library for Python)

And finally:
run `python main.py`
After 1-2 seconds, a fractal will appear.
